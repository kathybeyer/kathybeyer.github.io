<h1><b>About Me</b></h1>

I was born and grew up in Xiamen, a beautiful port city in Southeast China's Fujian Province.

I first learned photography from my Mom's Uncle, Ker Lin, a Middle School English teacher from the Philippines. Encouraged by his support and guidance, I knew I had found my passion.

After moving to the United States 29 years ago, I put photography aside for a few years to earn a living as a Software Engineer, but have thankfully been able to return to my passion through photography classes at Stanford University in 2016, and professional photography jobs at GradImages since 2017. I take graduations photos for Stanford University, UC Berkeley, UC San Francisco Medicine and many other Colleges and High Schools; foot race, i.e. Rock n Roll Half Marathon San Jose 2017. I took Football Sport Event photos for CallPlaybook.com in Levi'sÂ® Stadium April 2023. I am a photographer for Christmas/New Year Family parties, family birthday/graduation parties, dog halloween event, Los Altos Town Crier Magazine. I had my Exhibit at Loso Altos  library and Milpitas library in 2018. I strive to capture the world I see around me every day.
