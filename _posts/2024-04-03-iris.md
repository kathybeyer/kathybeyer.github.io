title: "Iris, Most Beautiful Flower"
---

Iris, most beautiful flower,<br>
Symbol of life, love, and light;<br>
Found by the brook, and the meadow,<br>
Or lofty, on arable height.<br>
You come in such glorious colors,<br>
In hues, the rainbow surpass;<br>
The chart of color portrays you,<br>
In petal, or veins, of your class.<br>
You bloom with the first in Winter,<br>
With the last, in the Fall, you still show;<br>
You steal the full beauty of Springtime,<br>
With your fragrance and sharp color glow.<br>
Your form and beauty of flower,<br>
An artist's desire of full worth;<br>
So Iris, we love you and crown you,<br>
MOST BEAUTIFUL FLOWER ON EARTH!<br>
-- Edith Buckner Edwards (AIS bulletin January 1961)
