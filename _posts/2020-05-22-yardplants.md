On the 8th of May<br>
I found something in a place<br>
Very tiny but super great<br>

One month ago today<br>
I built a farm in that place<br>
Made it ready for any plants<br>

With the seeds sowed in the earth<br>
I water the place day by day<br>
Will they grow up as I expect<br>

Exactly one month as of today<br>
Here comes a lovely plant<br>
With two embryonie leaves green like a jade<br>

It looks so promising<br>
Soon the place should be covered with green<br>
Oh my, that will be totally amazing<br>
