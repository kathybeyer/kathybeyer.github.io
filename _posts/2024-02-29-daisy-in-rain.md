title: "Daisy in the Rain"

A yellow gerber Daisy stays in the rain<br>
The rain makes Daisy shine like a stunning diamond<br>
It is such a symphony of colors and sounds<br>
I am thriled to look at life through my lens<br>

#### On the other hand, it was great to hear one of my neighbors in NextDoor said that it reminded him of this poem:

I looked up the word â€˜yellowâ€™ the other day.<br> 
I found so many shades of yellow that they had been distinguished by words like<br> 
gold<br>
honey<br>
daffodil.<br>
I found words like fire and sand and champagne and lemon and sunbeam and I even found a song.<br>
Now imagine someone telling yellow that itâ€™s â€˜just yellowâ€™.<br>
When yellow is a sunbeam and a daffodil and fire.<br>
When yellow is a song.<br>
Without yellow, we couldnâ€™t make orange and we couldnâ€™t create green and our world would be far less colourful because of it.<br>
Yellowâ€™s true colours are not limited to one thing.<br>
And neither are yours.<br>
Some days you are dark and fiery and intense.<br>
Some days you are rich and bright and vibrant.<br>
Some days you are buttercups and dandelions and some days you are champagne and a song.<br>
And without you, someoneâ€™s life would be far less bright and far less beautiful.<br> 
You are you as <br>
yellow is yellow.<br>
And the world needs you.<br>
Because, no matter what you think, you are not â€˜just youâ€™.<br>
You are so much more.<br>
