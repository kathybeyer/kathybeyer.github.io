Leaves<br>
by Elsie N. Brady

How silently they tumble down<br>
And come to rest upon the ground<br>
To lay a carpet, rich and rare,<br>
Beneath the trees without a care,<br>
Content to sleep, their work well done,<br>
Colors gleaming in the sun.<br>

At other times, they wildly fly<br>
Until they nearly reach the sky.<br>
Twisting, turning through the air<br>
Till all the trees stand stark and bare.<br>
Exhausted, drop to earth below<br>
To wait, like children, for the snow.
