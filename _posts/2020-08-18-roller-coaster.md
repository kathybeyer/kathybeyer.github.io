title: "Roller Coster"

Life can be up and down<br>
Like a roller coaster<br>

Aim it right<br>
It will go up right<br>
Go straight<br>
Go further<br>
Go faster<br>

Then it goes down<br>
For some reason<br>
No need to be upset<br>
No time for frustration<br>
Just work harder<br>
Think deeper<br>
Avoid the same mistake<br>

Life is tougher than a roller coaster<br>
Both up and down can be equal<br>
Just a matter of how you respond<br>
